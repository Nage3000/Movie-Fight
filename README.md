# Movie-Fight

 An application that compares two movies to find out which is better using the OMDB API. This project is a part of the The Modern Javascript Bootcamp with Stephen Grider.

While the UI is overtly simple, the logic used was relatively complex for a beginner. The autocomple.js file we created can be used at anytime in the future, which is a nice widget to have in the back pocket when auto-complete features pop up. 

A lot of this project was about refactoring to make the code cleaner and more efficient. Changing any aspect of this simple app requires changing only a few lines of code, instead of the duplicates we would have had to have written if we went with the initial strategy.
